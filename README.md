# Description

This is my first game built with js, html and css.

# How to play

Your goal in this game is to stack as many boxes as possible!
If you have three boxes of the same color touching each other, they will disappear. 
Use the arrow keys to navigate left or right and use the space key to drop the box.
If the tower gets too high, you loose...
